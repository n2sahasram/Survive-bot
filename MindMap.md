In times of **need**, public/users generally take to social media like twitter and facebook to communicate their requirements to the world. There is a disparity in the spread of information and delay in reaching to the intended officials.

**Steps involved**:

1. Twitter/Facebook bot to track a tag
2. Process information in the post(Name of user, contact info, filter geolocation)
